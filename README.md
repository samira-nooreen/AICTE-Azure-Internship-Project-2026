## 📋 Project Description
This project focuses on implementing a cloud-based solution using 
Microsoft Azure services. Leveraging my background in backend 
development, AI/ML pipelines, and CI/CD automation, the project 
demonstrates how Azure can be used to:
- Deploy scalable backend services on the cloud
- Utilize Azure AI services for intelligent data processing
- Implement secure and efficient cloud storage solutions
- Automate deployment workflows using Azure DevOps concepts

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Created a Microsoft Azure free account and set up the portal
2. Set up Resource Group to organize all Azure services
3. Configured required Azure services (Storage, VM, AI)
4. Implemented the cloud-based solution using Python/Java
5. Integrated Azure AI / Cognitive Services for smart processing
6. Tested and verified the final output on Azure Portal
7. Documented the entire process in PPT and converted to PDF

---

## 📊 Results & Output
- Successfully deployed the solution on Microsoft Azure
- All Azure services configured, integrated and tested
- Achieved efficient cloud-based processing and storage
- Project fully documented and submitted in PDF format
- Screenshots of Azure portal outputs included in repository

---

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Understood the concept of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in depth
- Learned to navigate and use the Azure Portal effectively
- Gained knowledge of Azure Storage, VMs and App Services
